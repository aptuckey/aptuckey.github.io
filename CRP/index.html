                <h2>General Overview</h2>
                <p>This RPX Report Viewer was a project that I developed to rapidly prototype Active Reports documents.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="app-tutorial">
                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                <p>The application takes two parameters; an Active Reports file(.RPX), and an XML file which contains the data for the report. Onces both parameters have been selected a sample document can be generated. You can use the auto gen button to automatically generate documents as changes are made and saved to the .RPX file.</p>
                <br/>
                <h2>Developing the app</h2>
                <p>I developed this application as part of a project at work. We often need to customize Active Reports, and these were previously tested by uploading the file to a customer site where a document could be generated by the program. The purpose of this project was to reduce testing time by rendering documents on a local device XML files that are pre-generated. The application parses and validates the XML, mapping elements to ActiveReports components while providing a user-friendly interface for loading and previewing reports. I integrated the ActiveReports library to render reports dynamically and implemented error handling to ensure reliability. Some of the technologies/skills exercised in this project wereC#, WinForms, XML processing, and third-party reporting tools.</p>
